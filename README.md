# Hello

This project is part of the course I attended on, called ["Reporting in SQL"](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-in-sql). I worked on an Olympic database to gained insight about this database. The database contains table such as: Athletes, Countries, Country Stats, Summer Games, and Winter Games. Most of the table I mentioned before, have a relationship with each other. Therefore creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). This ERD will play a part of my analysis, mainly when I joining some particular table. Below is the ERD of this project to help you understand of my query.
