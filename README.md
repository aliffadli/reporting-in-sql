# Hello

This project is part of the course I attended on, called ["Reporting in SQL"](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-in-sql). I worked on an Olympic database to gained insight about this database. The database contains table such as: Athletes, Countries, Country Stats, Summer Games, and Winter Games. Most of the table I mentioned before, have a relationship with each other. Therefore creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). This ERD will play a part of my analysis, mainly when I joining some particular table. Below is the ERD of this project to help you understand of my query.

Before starting with this project, you must create and insert values into the database. To do that, first you must run the specific query for creating the tables and inserting the values. I already saved those query on [reporting-in-sql/create_database.sql](https://github.com/aliffadli/reporting-in-sql/blob/main/create_database.sql) for you to run it. After that, you can play with all of my other scripts whichever you want.

Below is the explanation of each script:

1. [exploring.sql](https://github.com/aliffadli/reporting-in-sql/blob/main/exploring.sql) is used for data exploration and undestrading about the ERD. 
2. [create_report.sql](https://github.com/aliffadli/reporting-in-sql/blob/main/create_report.sql) mainly used for practice creating a complex query.  
3. [clean_validate.sql](https://github.com/aliffadli/reporting-in-sql/blob/main/clean_validate.sql) is used to deal with messy data by fixing data type issues, cleaning messy strings, handling nulls, and removing duplication.  
4. [complex_calculation.sql](https://github.com/aliffadli/reporting-in-sql/blob/main/complex_calculation.sql) is used to build a more complicated fields using window functions and layered calculations.

# Thank You!
